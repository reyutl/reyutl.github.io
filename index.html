        <strong>"The Orange Girl"</strong> by Jostein Gaarder is a novel narrated by a 15-year-old boy named Georg Røed, who discovers a letter written by his deceased father, Jan Olav, containing a story titled "The Orange Girl".
        This story recounts Jan Olav's encounter with a mysterious girl on a tram, clutching a bag of oranges, and his subsequent search to find her.
        Through the letter and the story, Georg learns about his parents' love story and grapples with questions about life, death, and the universe,
        ultimately realizing the "orange girl" is his own mother. I’m not really an avid reader, but the story of this book was so captivating that I finished it in less than a week.
        It has become one of my favorite books.

        <strong>Dead Poets Society</strong> is an inspiring drama set in the 1950s at a strict and traditional boarding school called <strong>Welton Academy</strong>.<br><br>

        The arrival of a new English teacher, <strong>Mr. Keating</strong> (played by Robin Williams), transforms the lives of a group of students.
        With his unconventional teaching methods, he encourages them to <em>think for themselves</em> and to seize the day — famously urging them with the phrase <strong>"Carpe Diem."</strong><br><br>

        One of the students, <strong>Neil</strong>, discovers his passion for acting thanks to Mr. Keating’s support. However, his strict father strongly disapproves.
        Unable to pursue his dreams and feeling trapped, Neil makes a tragic decision.<br><br>

        The school blames Mr. Keating and forces him to leave.
        In the final scene, the students who were inspired by him stand on their desks and say, <strong>"Oh Captain! My Captain!"</strong> as a tribute to his impact on their lives.<br><br>

        The film delivers a powerful message about the importance of <strong>creativity, independent thinking, and the courage to follow your dreams</strong>.
